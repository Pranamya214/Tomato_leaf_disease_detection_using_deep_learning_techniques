#🌿 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques 🍅🤖🌿

I’m excited to share my latest project on Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using deep learning techniques! This project aims to enhance agricultural productivity by accurately identifying and classifying diseases on tomato leaves, enabling timely intervention and better crop management.
Project Overview:

🔍 Objective: Develop a deep learning model to automatically detect and classify various diseases affecting tomato plants from leaf images.

🛠️ Approach:

Data Collection: Compiled a diverse dataset of tomato leaf images, covering multiple disease types.
Model Development: Leveraged Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
Training & Validation: Fine-tuned the model with techniques such as data augmentation and cross-validation to improve robustness and generalization.

Key Results:

Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 99% in classifying diseases, significantly reducing false positives and false negatives.
Impact: Facilitated quicker and more reliable disease identification, contributing to more effective pest management and better crop yields.
